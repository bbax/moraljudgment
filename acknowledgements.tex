I would like to thank my advisers Tali Mendelberg, Marty Gilens, Omar Wasow, and LaFleur Stephens for their help and support. I would also like to thank the Princeton Politics Department Behavior Workshop and the Center for the Study of Democratic Politics for their financial support. Many others have given me helpful feedback and suggestions throughout the project. To name just a few: Steve Snell, Katie Donovan, Meredith Sadin, Mateusz Tomkowiak, Michael Barber, and Aram Hur. I presented various stages of this work at the Princeton Politics Department's Graduate Research Seminar in American Politics and at the 2014 and 2015 annual meetings of the Midwest Political Science Association. I thank the chairs, discussants, and participants at those meetings for their feedback.

Most of all I am indebted to my wife, Gwendolyn, for her unwavering support throughout the marathon of graduate school. She sacrificed greatly so that I could pursue a life of the mind. She made all of this possible. Furthermore, my daughter, Lucy, has given me her love and joy, which mean so much to me and have kept me going.
